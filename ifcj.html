<p>The IFCJ website was interesting because I learned a lot about building content on a CMS such as WordPress. It was a highly time-sensitive environment. There were newsletters and articles that had to be published by a certain time of day. I also worked with two other developers in crafting some JavaScript and working with a proprietary language for syncing their desktop tasks.</p>
