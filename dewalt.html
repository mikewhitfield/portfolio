									<p>While working on this site I was in the largest development team I had been in to date. There was a group of 12 of us. This is significant because it was on this project that I got experience with version controlling shared documents. It was also on this site that I continued work on a project that featured .Net syntax for all of its pages. I was also a part of the debugging team. We were responsible for testing and troubleshooting errors ranging on browsers from Chrome back to IE6.</p>
